Update on progress
I have successfully integrated my files into the glimma vignette, added race to each corresponding file, matched the Ensemble
gene name to its gene id using the Homo.sapiens library, and begun preliminary analysis. 

Feedback
Did not have a chance to meet as I was at a conference.

Known Issues
Ran into issues trying to get into the correct working directory where all the sample files were located. Ultimately had to 
create a variable for the working directory to include in the script. I also had to remove the decimal point and any numerical
values after it from all Ensemble names in order to annotate them.

Next steps
I am adding the age of each sample so that both race and age are analyzed when studying differential gene expression. I will
then comlpete the glimma vignette with this information and conduct statstical analysis to finish off the project.
