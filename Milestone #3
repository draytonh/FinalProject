Update on progress
I have successfully run the RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma, and edgeR vignette. I successfully produced a
heatmap demonstrating the results of the statistical analyses which show that there are no differentially expressed genes
when you compare black patients with endometrial cancer vs. white patients with endometrial cancer.

Feedback
We discussed changing some of the labeling used, lowering the threshold for significance to establish hits for study, and
incorporating the camera method for the final product.

Known Issues
Since I only have two groups being compared there is no Venn Diagram and I had to use the funciton heatmap instead of heatmap.2.
I did not have any significantly different expressed genes between the black and white patients, so I did not run the camera 
method. The camera method also did not work in the vignette when running the unit test so we decided at the time that 
it was not worth pursuing at the onset.

Next steps
Lower threshold to achieve significance, get camera method to work, fix labeling issues in the vignette, make sure that missing
gene names are populated.
