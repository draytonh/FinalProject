Update on progress
This past week I focused on getting the "RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, glimma, and edgeR" vignette to work. 
When I reached the "Useful graphical representations of differential expression results" portion of the vignette, 
I ran into errors that there was a discongruence between the number of rows. I started over on writing the script into an 
R notebook, and was able to make the vignette work. 

Feedback
We discussed the possibility of adding in age or age at diagnosis to the analysis. 

Known Issues
The only remaining issue in the vignette, is that the camera method still does not work, but it is nto necessary for 
the differential gene expression analysis.

Next steps
Getting all of the htseq.counts files formatted to work within the vignette, and adding information about age.
