## Set-up
#Download files: 
#Samples were selected from the NIH National Cancer Institute GDC Data Portal and were filtered for White and Black or African American race, not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The files were filtered to be from the TCGA-UCEC project, the disease type to be cystic, mucinous, or serous neoplasms (as these are clinically more severe malignancies), the experimental strategy as RNA-Seq, and the workflow type as HTSeq-Counts.

#Samples: African American (aa) n = 25, Caucasian (c) n = 50

#To download files, apply the filteres described above (or utilize the below url), go to each individual file name on the TCGA website, and select download.
